# a-Journal

a-journal is an example project on how one can structure a web project in Go.

It consists of a bunch of REST services which delivers data formatted in JSON as well as a frontend app that is written with the javascript library RiotJS (http://riotjs.com). Bulma (http://bulma.io) css framework is used for layout and styling.

The goal of this project is to serve as an example to build a SaaS solution using mostly stdlib. I do however use third party libraries in places where i see no need to roll my own.

The future of this project could end up in an actually hosted paid version, however the code base will remain open for either self hosting or for verifying that the project "doesn't do evil".

It is still in heavy development so not all things are stable and many features are still missing.

Planned Coming features:

*   Support for multiple membership tiers
*   Stripe integration
*   Solid backend logging
*   Frontend logging
